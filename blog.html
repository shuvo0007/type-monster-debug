        <li class="blog-li">What is the difference between local storage session storage?<p><span class="ans-span">Answer: </span>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.</p></li>
        <li class="blog-li">What is the difference between global scope and blog scope?<p><span class="ans-span">Answer: </span>A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. <br> <span style="padding-left: 95px;">Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope.</span></p></li>
        <li class="blog-li">How does JavaScript event loop works?<p><span class="ans-span">Answer: </span>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p></li>
        <li class="blog-li">How many ways undefined error can occur?<p><span class="ans-span">Answer: </span>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p></li>
